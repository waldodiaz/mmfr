# Biography

I am interested in studying the modifications of the human microbiota of various parts of our body, intestinal, skin, breast milk, among others. In addition, I am interested in the study of microorganisms isolated from these same microbiots in relation to their resistance to metals and antibiotics. Also, we interested in the development of new functional foods that have properties as symbiotics.

The Molecular microbiolgy and food research laboratratory (MMFRLAB) belongs to nutrition and dietetics of Faculty of health care sciences

Mission

"The MMFR group corresponds to a molecular microbiology research laboratory, is composed by under- and graduate students that pursue to promote formation of advanced human capital, development of research at the university, with cctive participation in research, development and innovation. our work are focused mainly on basic and applied science research, along with development, innovation, and realtion with the environment. The lab wants to promote the scientific growth of its members in scientific, attitudinal and relational terms, valuing respect, discipline and the motivation for scientific work. "

Vission

"To become a leading research lab in Chile, working mainly in molecular microbiology and food research; being recognized for human skills quality and instruction of under- and graduate students."
